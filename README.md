# stun

A [RFC 5389](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5389) STUN server written in Rust. Just for fun~

Please note I haven't actually tested this yet.

## Running

Change the port number by editing `config.toml`. One needs to install [Rust](https://rustup.rs) beforehand.

```bash
cargo run --release
```
